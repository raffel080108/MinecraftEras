# It is not recommended to have multiple eras that have the same score requirements, although the plugin will make no attempt to verify this
# If an era with a lower era-score requirement than the current era-score is added, that era will be completed immediately upon being registered
# Please note, that the default era-score when first loading the plugin is -1 by design. This means to properly initialize an era with 0 required points (such as the first era in the provided examples), you will need to manually add 1 era-score (using "/mce addEraScore 1"). This is to avoid improper initialization, because since nobody is online, nobody gets any messages about this first era or anything like that
